# PowerBi-HotelBookings-Dashboard
This project analyzes hotel booking patterns and customer loyalty to help optimize revenue management and marketing strategies. The dashboard provides insights into:
Booking Volume Over Time: Tracking the number of stays per day and identifying peak seasons (e.g., the notable increase in early-mid October).
Day of Week Trends: Comparing booking counts between weekdays and weekends to inform staffing and promotional scheduling.
Advance Booking Behavior: Analyzing how far in advance customers book their stays (e.g., the majority booking "Before 1 week").
Loyalty Segmentation: Breaking down the Booking Count by Loyalty Level (Non-member, Iconic, Elite, etc.) and by Booking Source).
🛠 Tools Used
Data Source: Excel
Visualization & Analysis: Microsoft Power BI Desktop
